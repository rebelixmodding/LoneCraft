      <section id="main_content">
        <p>So, welcome everybody ! I wanted you to know that the newly created Rebelix Modding team is now working on thier frist mod project ! I, Redstonize, am the project leader, and will guide you through if you want to know more about that ! Let's start by presenting ourselves. </p>

<p>----------------Presentation</p>

<p>My name is Redstonize, and I am a mature and entrepreneur guy from Qu√©bec, Canada.
Sorry for my bad english. May I do some errors in my sentences, but you may know I always do my best to communicate even with It and even If I can't be there everyday. We'll have a great atmosphere if you do work with me and prehaps this project could even be fun , all depends on your implication Posted Image ! ... Okay. So .. I am not a realy tough coder or any thing like that, but I have good understanding of computer languages and I still can make the difference between java and javascript. I already make my proofs with Lua by modding simple games like don't starve. .. So, no, I'm not a dummy. I'ts just a question of rescources : I don't actually have the tools nor the concentration to make mods in minecraft. I'l be your leader and It is my job to give you all the credit you need and as a leader must do .. to lead you when you need help.</p>

<p>----------------Mod Overview</p>

<p>Lone Craft is a mod that actually may make you feel no more alone when you are
playing singleplayer. It's a real gift to the player that can't play with his friends because he has no internet or simply because he don't have any. No longer, with Lone Craft, you will feel so much useless in an infinite world. This mod will totally realize your dreams. Ah.. would'n it be wonderfull to have a server where all of your players work at thier occupations peacefully while you are watching them from above your admin-cloud ? Or prehaps you would prefer a world where war is always on and where factions of warriors raise from the ground to reign, then finally fall and leave it's place to the nature to take it's real place ?</p>

<p>These days where you are part of a server are back. It's now your turn to take your
sword and unite these lands by the force of the armies you will forge. Your turn to
Build up cities with your new workforce, and look at these peasants to cultivate thier farms,
to chop down forests, to chase them monsters and to live thier lives. Shall you may be a rich
noble, a knight, a lord or a citizen, you now have the choice. Choice to be an heretic that lives
in the jungle with his neighbors nearby, choice to be the king and that will rule the world, choice
to just live and let live by settling your colony where ever the hell you want. Choice to build yourself a little cozy lakeside manor and invite important people so you can throw ball parties. Choice to go hunt down these scruby creepers with your personnal assistants or your friends. Choice to make yourself some relationships and have people to know you. Chance to hire guards to keep specific places of your castle and to pay bodyguards that will get better stuff and will follow you. Chance to manage the whole domain and to set your servant's very own bed and home. May he sleep on the carpet or may he get a nice bedroom for himself. Because now ..... you are no more ALONE !</p>

<p>----------------Less talking, more working</p>

<p>So that was for the overview part I guess.
The plan, because we need to stay organized, is to work on each segment of the mod one-by-one. And thus, if we get many people working, will get just better and faster. We will have some mod "updates" that will add few more stuff to the mod each. This way we can provide a better content and we can concentrate on specific objectives. You probably think something like "OMG this is going to be much too hard for me" or "Woot! What a page of unspecific instructions for a modder like me". Well this is the reason I said that this text above is just a "summum" of the mod. Also note that if you help me, I give you all the credit you want. Your name will get in the title of the mod, or something like that.
------------------Road Map
Because we need to stay organized, we also need a road map. A road map is basically an over-plannifying of a project, that details different phases and work states of the said process.</p>
